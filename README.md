## 👀 Overview

![Teaser Image](assets/teaser.png)

> Rather than restricting VLM reasoning to a discrete language space with limited representational capacity, **CoVT** forms a visual thought chain that enables VLMs to reason in continuous visual space. By introducing *continuous visual tokens* that encode perceptual cues (e.g., segmentation, depth, instance, and edge structure), CoVT composes *chains of textual and visual thoughts* that link semantic reasoning with perceptual grounding. These visual “thought chains” bridge language and vision, enabling fine-grained understanding, spatial precision, and geometric awareness beyond the reach of text-based reasoning.

<summary><strong>💡 Abstract</strong></summary>

<br>

Vision–Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, *e.g.*, spatial reasoning and geometric awareness.This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce **Chain-of-Visual-Thought (CoVT)**, a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through **continuous visual tokens** — compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly **20 tokens**, CoVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts capturing complementary properties such as **2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure**. During training, a VLM equipped with CoVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (*e.g.*, depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual-token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than **ten diverse perception benchmarks**, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating CoVT into strong VLMs such as **Qwen2.5-VL** and **LLaVA** consistently improves performance by **3% to 16%**, demonstrating that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.

<summary><strong>🧩 Pipeline</strong></summary>

![Pipeline Image](assets/pipeline.png)

> **Continuous visual thinking with CoVT.** CoVT introduces compact, continuous visual tokens that encode fine-grained perceptual cues, such as object localization, spatial structure, and scene semantics, directly into VLM reasoning. These tokens ground multimodal reasoning in visual space, enabling the model to capture fine-grained relationships across vision-centric tasks (e.g., counting, depth ordering, and scene understanding) without relying on external tools. They can also be decoded into dense predictions, offering human-interpretable visualizations of the model's reasoning process.

![Method Image](assets/method.png)

> **The training pipeline of CoVT.** CoVT first generates the thinking process, containing visual thinking tokens, and then leverages these visual thoughts to condition next-token prediction and reason the final answer. To endow these tokens with perceptual meaning, we align them with lightweight vision experts (e.g., SAM, DepthAnything, PIDINet, DINO) on their respective tasks during training. Specifically: SAM uses 8 visual tokens as mask prompts; DepthAnything uses 4 tokens to reconstruct depth; PIDINet uses 4 tokens to reconstruct edges; and DINO uses 4 tokens to match patch-level features. The VLM is finetuned with LoRA and all projection layers are trainable. ***Note: During inference, dense predictions are decoded only when interpretability is desired; otherwise, reasoning occurs entirely in the latent visual space.***

> **Comparison of CoVT with the baseline and closed-source models.** CoVT delivers consistent improvements across all vision-centric benchmarks and further reveals that each type of visual token contributes most effectively to the tasks that align with its encoded perceptual information.

## 🚀 Quick Start!

### Evaluation

To ensure consistency and reproducibility, we use **VLMEvalKit** as the framework for evaluating models. In our repository, we have forked a copy of VLMEvalKit. You can have a quick start by following this [instruction](docs/Eval.md).

### Gradio Demo

We provid an interactive demo built with [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio), showcasing a conversational interface powered by the CoVT VLM. The demo allows users to upload images, ask questions, and interact with the model in real time through a simple web UI. You can have a quick start following [here](docs/Demo.md).
